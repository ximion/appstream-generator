ancient-metadata:
  text: The AppStream metadata should be updated to follow a more recent version of the specification.<br/>
        Please consult <a href="http://freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Quickstart.html">the XML quickstart guide</a> for more information.
  severity: info

description-from-package:
  text: This component gets its description from the package it is located in.<br/>
        This has several disadvantages, like missing localization, possibly too short descriptions, too technical descriptions for users of software centers, etc.<br/>
        Please consider writing a metainfo file for this component. In the near future, components without metainfo file might be dropped from the metadata.
        You can consult the <a href="http://freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Quickstart.html">XML quickstart guide</a> for more information on how to write
        a metainfo file.

  severity: error

icon-format-unsupported:
  text: "Icon file '%(icon_fname)s' uses an unsupported image file format."
  severity: error

icon-not-found:
  text: >
        The icon '%(icon_fname)s' was not found in the archive. This issue can have multiple reasons:
        <ul>
         <li>The icon is not present in the archive.</li>
         <li>The icon is in a wrong directory.</li>
         <li>The icon is not available in a suitable size (at least 64x64px)</li>
        </ul>
        To make the icon easier to find, place it in <code>/usr/share/icons/hicolor/&lt;size&gt;/apps</code> and ensure the <code>Icon=</code> value
        of the .desktop file is set correctly.
  severity: error

icon-open-failed:
  text: >
        Unable to open icon file '%(icon_fname)s'. Error: %(error)s<br/>
        This means the generator could not render the icon to its appropriate size, and the icon has therefore been ignored.
  severity: error

deb-filelist-error:
  text: Could not determine file list for '%(pkg_fname)s'. This could be an error in the archive, dpkg, apt_pkg or the DEP-11 generator.<br/>

deb-empty-file:
  text: File '%(fname)s' from package '%(pkg_fname)s' appeared to be empty.<br/>
        It could also be a broken symbolic link, or a link pointing to a file in a different package (in that case, please replace
        the link with the actual file).
  severity: error

metainfo-no-id:
  text: Could not determine an id for this component. The AppStream upstream metadata likely lacks an <code>&lt;id/&gt;</code> tag.<br/>
        The identifier tag is absolutely essential for AppStream metadata, and must never be missing.
  severity: error

missing-desktop-file:
  text: Found an AppStream upstream XML file, but the associated .desktop file is missing. This often happens when the .desktop file is renamed, but the
        <code>&lt;id/&gt;</code> tag of the AppStream metainfo file is not adapted as well, or if the metainfo file is located in a different package than the .desktop file.<br/>
        Please fix the packaging or work with upstream to resolve this issue.

        Error while reading screenshot data for '%(url)s' of component '%(cpt_id)s': %(error)s<br/>
        Maybe the server returned an invalid image (e.g. an error page), or the image data is broken.
  severity: warning

metainfo-no-type:
  text: Component has no type defined. A component type (desktop, input-method, generic, ...) is essential. This issue is likely
        an internal bug in the data extractor.
  severity: error

metainfo-unknown-type:
  text: The component-type '%(type)s' is unknown. Please make sure this component type is mentioned in the specification, and that the
        <code>type=</code> property of the component root-node of the metainfo file does not contain a typing error.
  severity: error

metainfo-no-name:
  text: Component has no name specified. Ensure that the AppStream upstream metadata or the .desktop file (if there is any) specify a component name.
  severity: error

metainfo-no-package:
  text: Component has no package defined. A package must be associated with a component. This is likely a bug in the generator.
  severity: error

metainfo-no-summary:
  text: >
        Component does not contain a short summary. Ensure that the components metainfo file has a <code>summary</code> tag, or that its .desktop file
        has a <code>Comment=</code> field set. Especially applications by KDE often use the <code>GenericName</code> field for a short summary,
        instead of the <code>Comment</code> field (which is not its intended use case).<br/>

metainfo-localized-field-without-template:
  text: The field '%(field_id)s' has no untranslated template entry ("C"). This is usually an error in the accompanying .desktop file, or the translation
        template in the AppStream XML is missing.
  severity: error

metainfo-duplicate-id:
  text: The component-id '%(cid)s' already appeared in package '%(pkgname)s'. AppStream-IDs must be unique, please resolve which package will be
        providing this component by default.<br/>
        This issue may happen temporarily when metadata is moved from one package to another. In that case, ignore this issue, it will vanish soon.
